  <h1> Stella and Rosie's Cat Rescue</h1>

<div id="history">
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Stella and Rosie’s Cat Rescue Center was inspired by our founders two cats, Stella and Rosie, who were previously held at a local rescue center.  When searching for cats online and at local humane societies, our founder was shocked by the number of cats who did not have homes. She found that many of these cats were not desirable, to some people, because of training issues. From that moment on, she knew she wanted to create a rescue center focused solely on cat rescue and rehabilitation.  <strong>The two cats pictured below are the founders cats, Stella (on the left) and Rosie (on the right)<strong>.</p>
